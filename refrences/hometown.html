                    Redmond, Oregon, was founded in 1910 and quickly developed as a key community in Central Oregon thanks to the arrival of the Oregon Trunk Railway. Originally a small farming and ranching town, Redmond benefited from an extensive irrigation system that transformed the surrounding high desert into fertile land. Its strategic location near major transportation routes helped the city grow steadily over the decades. Today, Redmond serves as a gateway to outdoor adventure, blending small-town friendliness with access to some of Oregon’s most stunning natural landscapes.

                    One of Redmond’s most famous nearby attractions is Smith Rock State Park, a world-renowned rock climbing destination that draws visitors from all over the globe. The city’s downtown area has also seen major revitalization, featuring historic buildings, public art, and a lively restaurant scene. Redmond is home to the Deschutes County Fair & Expo Center, which hosts major events including concerts, rodeos, and the annual county fair. With its expanding regional airport, beautiful parks, and close proximity to the Cascade Mountains, Redmond has become a popular destination for both visitors and new residents looking for a vibrant community surrounded by outdoor opportunities.
